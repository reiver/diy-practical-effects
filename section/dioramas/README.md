# Dioramas ([DIY Practical Effects](../../README.md))

A **diorama** is a representation of a three-dimensional (3D) scene.

A common type of **diorama** is the scaled miniature **diorama**,
where a three-dimensional (3D) scene is shrunk to some scale.

For example, some common scales for the scale of the miniature diorama are:

## Common Scales

* **1/4 scale** — “1/4” is also sometimes written as “1:4”, at “¹⁄₄”
* **1/6 scale** — also sometimes called the **12 inch scale** — “1/6” is also sometimes written as “1:6”, at “¹⁄₆”
* **1/8 scale** — “1/8” is also sometimes written as “1:8”, at “¹⁄₈”
* **1/12 scale** — also sometimes called the **6 inch scale** — “1/12” is also sometimes written as “1:12”, at “¹⁄₁₂”
* **1/16 scale** — “1/16” is also sometimes written as “1:16”, at “¹⁄₁₆”
* **1/18 scale** — “1/18” is also sometimes written as “1:18”, at “¹⁄₁₈”
* **1/24 scale** — “1/24” is also sometimes written as “1:24”, at “¹⁄₂₄”
* **1/28 scale** — “1/28” is also sometimes written as “1:28”, at “¹⁄₂₈”
* **1/32 scale** — “1/32” is also sometimes written as “1:32”, at “¹⁄₃₂”
* **1/48 scale** — “1/48” is also sometimes written as “1:48”, at “¹⁄₄₈”
