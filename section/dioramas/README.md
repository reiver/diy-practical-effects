# Dioramas ([DIY Practical Effects](../../README.md))

A **diorama** is a representation of a three-dimensional (3D) scene.

A common type of **diorama** is the scaled miniature **diorama**,
where a three-dimensional (3D) scene is shrunk to some scale.

For example, some common scales for the scale of the miniature diorama are:
