# Don Wood Tapered Mold Box ([DIY Practical Effects](../../README.md))

[Mold Boxes](../mold-box/README.md) are used when creating a mold.
Some [mold boxes](../mold-box/README.md) are also used to hold the mold when casting.

A **Don Wood Tapered Mold Box** is specific type of [mold box](../mold-box/README.md) [introduced Paul Hamler on YouTube](https://youtu.be/sMf-q1K4XNM?t=920).
When [Paul Hamler](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3VmPL7Gq4bGEYVOZ9aGB5g) showed these _tapered mold boxes_ he says his friend _Don Wood_ showed him these types of mold boxes.

**Don Wood Tapered Mold Boxes** are reusable.

**Don Wood Tapered Mold Boxes** can be used to create two-part molds.

**Don Wood Tapered Mold Boxes** are (also) used to hold the mold when casting (in addition to being used to create the mold).

In fact, the tapering of the **Don Wood Tapered Mold Boxes** is not only used to securely hold the mold (when casting), but also used to apply even pressure on the mold to reduce, and even prevent _flashing_.
