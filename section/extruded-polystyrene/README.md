# Extruded Polystyrene ([DIY Practical Effects](../../README.md))

**Extruded Polystyrene** a form of [polystyrene](../polystyrene/README.md).

**Extruded Polystyrene** is a rigid foam material that is created by when [polystyrene](../polystyrene/README.md) is put through an **extrusion** process.

**Extruded Polystyrene** is often abbreviated as **XPS**.
I.e., _eXtruded PolyStyene_ = XPS .

## Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) versus Extruded Polystyrene (XPS)

**WARNING**: do not confuse **EPS** — which is an abbreviation for **expanded polystyrene** — with **extruded polystyrene** (**XPS**).

Although both **expanded polystyrene** (**EPS**), and **extruded polystyrene** (**XPS**) are forms of [polystyrene](../polystyrene/README.md) and even have _some_ similarities between them,
they are different materials with some important differences between them.

**You want _extruded polystyrene_ (XPS)**.
