# Injection Molding ([DIY Practical Effects](../../README.md))

**Injection Molding** is a [casting](../casting/README.md) technique where (typically) a hot material is pressure injected into a mold.

Typically, the injected material is a plastic, or wax.

## Tabletop Injection Molding Machines

One can make, and purchase _injection molding machines_.

There are a number of companies that make (relatively) more affordable injection mold machines.
These include:

* Techkit machines
* Galomb Machine
* Medium Machinery
* Honajector
* Morgan press
* Thermoject
* Iasco
* Megatron
* Pitsco

## LNS Technologies

[LNS Technologies](https://www.techkits.com/) makes a more affordable _injection molding machine_ (compared to the alteratives).

Their [MODEL 150A PLASTIC INJECTION MACHINE](https://www.techkits.com/products/model-150a/) is USD $1,800.
Which, although it is expensive to the hobbyist, is much less expensive that typical commercial _injection molding machines_.
