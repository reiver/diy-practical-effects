# High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) Recycling ([DIY Practical Effects](../../README.md))

[High-Density Polyethylene](../hdpe/README.md) ([HDPE](../hdpe/README.md)) is a form of [polyethylene](../polyethylene/README.md).

[HDPE](../hdpe/README.md) can be easliy found, as it is used to create all sorts of things;
including: _bottle crates_, _milk jugs_, _pipes_, _water bottles_, etc etc.

Some of these objects built from [HDPE](../hdpe/README.md) — such a _HDPE milk jugs_ — are very regularly thrown out as waste.
This means that, if you collect these discarded _HDPE milk jugs_ (and recycle them) you could have an effectively _free_ source of [HDPE](../hdpe/README.md),
as a raw material for your ([DIY practical effects](../../README.md)) work.

When using [HDPE](../hdpe/README.md) as a raw material for your ([DIY practical effects](../../README.md)) work,
normal _‘woodworking tools’_ can be used for cut, sand, and shape [HDPE](../hdpe/README.md).

## Identifying HDPE

One way to identify that something is made out of ([HDPE](../hdpe/README.md)) is by looking for the HDPE **resin code** — **resin code 2**.
