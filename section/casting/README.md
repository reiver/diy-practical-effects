# Casting ([DIY Practical Effects](../../README.md))

**Casting** is a technique used to created things.

When **casting** a mold forms the _negative_ of what is wanted to be created.

A liquid — such as (very hot) metal, resin, concrete, etc — is poured into the mold.

The liquid turns into a solid, and takes on the shape left empty by the modl.

## Variations

There are different types of castings.

Some of the different types include:

* [lost wax casting](../lost-wax-casting/README.md)
