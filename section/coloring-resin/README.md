# Coloring Resin ([DIY Practical Effects](../../README.md))

Sometimes a person may want to give a [resin](../resin/README.md) a color.

(NOTE, this is NOT the same thing as painting (on top of) the resin. This is making the resin itself colored.)

There are commercial dyes you can buy for this. But you can also use items you might have not expected for this.
